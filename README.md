# Introduction

Welcome to the Social and Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab Manual!

This manual was developed and is maintained by the lab coordinators of the SCCN Lab, with guidance from the PI, Stefano Anzellotti. It is intended to represent Stefano's vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing Boston College [policies](http://www.bc.edu/offices/policies/universitypolicies.html) (which take precedence). **Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual and sign a [form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16BUB3OQkAAz6h7jlv4cxPBYgsAZ0f6uN4BoWdakmRNM/edit?usp=sharing) indicating that they have done so.** More information may be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please contact Stefano.

## Lab philosophy
To be added by Stefano. :)

# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Do work that others will care about.
- Double- and triple-check your work. Being a little obsessive is essential to good science.
- Be supportive of your labmates. We are a team.
- Work independently when you can; ask for help when you need it.
- Share your knowledge. Mentorship can take many forms.
- Respect each other's strengths, weaknesses, differences, identities, and beliefs.
- Respect each other's right to have a safe, clean, quiet, and comfortable working environment. 
- Science is a marathon, not a sprint. Take personal time/vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab.
- If you have an issue with another lab member that cannot be solved by talking with them about it, please talk with Stefano. If you have an issue with Stefano, please reach out to another member of the Psychology Department who can intervene (this can be a lab coordinator for smaller lab issues, or another faculty member or the department chair for more serious issues).
- Academia may feel different from other types of jobs, but it is still a job. You should treat coming into the lab with the same respect that you would treat any other position. See [Hours](#hours).

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and take care of yourself, and don't risk getting others sick.
- Notify a lab coordinator or Stefano if you will be away, whether due to illness or travel. If you are sick and you had meetings or in-person experiments scheduled that day, notify your collaborators or participants and reschedule.
- You are not expected to come into lab on [staff holidays](http://www.bc.edu/offices/hr/resources/campusinfo/holidays.html). If you are being paid, then you *are* expected to come into lab during university breaks (except for staff holidays or if you're taking [paid vacation time](http://www.bc.edu/offices/hr/resources/handbook/hbk-benefits.html#vac)).
- You aren't expected to work 80 hours a week, or to work from precisely 9am - 5pm every day. You *are* expected to show up to all of your commitments (classes, meetings) and to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it, and in the hours you need to get it done).
- Lock the door to the lab if no one else is around, even if you're only stepping out for a minute.
- Keep the lab tidy. Food messes and spills should be cleaned up promptly, dirty dishes taken home with you, and common areas should be kept free of clutter. 
- The dress code is generally casual. The only request is that you look semi-professional if interacting with participants face-to-face and when presenting your work - jeans are fine; workout clothing and pajamas are not.

## PI
You can expect Stefano to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research projects 
- Share his perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing [recommendation letters](#recommendation-letters) for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s graduate school, a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia
- Care about you, both as a person and as a scientist

## Postdocs
You will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding (e.g., NRSA). Stefano will hire postdocs only when there is funding available for at least one year; however, applying for external funding is a valuable experience and, if awarded, it will release those dedicated funds for other purposes
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the beginning of your fourth year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research
- Remind Stefano that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab! 

## Graduate students
You will be expected to:
- Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document
- Mentor undergraduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate - they can help you collect data and this will give you some experience with mentoring and managing a team
- Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
- Apply for external funding (e.g., NSF, GRFP, or NRSA). This is a valuable experience that is best to get early
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need
- Stay up-to-date (and keep Stefano up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements
- Prioritize time for research. It is easy to get caught up in coursework or TA-ing, but ultimately your research is how you earn your PhD 

## Lab coordinators
You will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project (developed with Stefano’s help)
- Maintain the lab IRB protocols and paperwork, including submitting amendments when necessary
- Handle lab finances when appropriate, such as purchasing food/supplies, keeping track of receipts, and completing p-card paperwork
- Coordinate meetings and events, including lab meetings, one-on-one meetings between Stefano and other lab members, invited research talks, and lab social events; book rooms, update the lab calendar, and send reminders by email when appropriate
- Oversee the hiring and scheduling of undergraduate research assistants (except for cases when Stefano is handling this directly)
- Maintain the lab website and lab wiki; update the lab manual
- Check the [lab email address](mailto:sccnlab@gmail.com) regularly; take care of any emails that you can, forward the rest to Stefano
- Help new lab members with onboarding, including giving them access to the lab wiki and lab calendar, and adding them to the lab email lists
- Assist with participant recruitment/scheduling and booking testing rooms for in-person experiments
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis when asked or when appropriate
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab

## Other full-time staff
You will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects)
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab
- Provide extra support to the lab coordinator(s)

## Undergraduate students
You will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (unless you are working on your own independent project under the mentorship of another lab member, in which case you should work on that)
- Work with a lab coordinator and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule; you should be coming in every week, and scheduling enough time to get your work done
- Provide extra support to the lab coordinator (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask a lab coordinator or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with
- *If you are earning course credit for research, you must additionally:*
  - Attend lab meetings when your course schedule permits
  - Present at one meeting during the semester
  - Write a short essay on your research topic or experiences at the end of the semester
- For more information about undergraduate research positions, refer to the [Undergraduate research](#undergraduate-research) section below.

# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics have been covered above in the [Lab member expectations & responsibilities](#lab-member-expectations-and-responsibilities) section.

**In addition:**

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree to the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the Boston College Discriminatory Harassment Policy, which can be found [here](http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/offices/policies/pdf/policies/I/1-200-025.pdf), as well as many other essential Boston College policies, which can be found [here](https://www.bc.edu/offices/diversity/compliance.html).

### Discrimination & harassment

The lab is dedicated to providing a discrimination- and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, culture, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, discussions, or outings.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any discriminatory and/or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Stefano immediately. If Stefano is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to the department chair or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event or gathering, and in all lab communications.

## Scientific integrity

### Research (mis)conduct
The lab, and Boston College, is committed to ensuring research integrity, and we take a hard line on research misconduct. We will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. Read BC’s policies on the conduct of research carefully (main page [here](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/research/sites/vice-provost-for-research/integrity-and-compliance/research-misconduct.html), institutional policy [here](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/offices/policies/doc/policies/IV/4-210-020.pdf), more information [here](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/research/sites/vice-provost-for-research/integrity-and-compliance/research-integrity-principles.html)).

A big problem is why people feel the need to engage in misconduct in the first place. If you are feeling pressured to succeed (publish a lot, publish in high impact journals), you should reach out to Stefano to talk about it – but this pressure is something we all face and is *never* an excuse to fabricate, falsify, or plagiarize. Also, think about the goal of science and why we are here: we’re here to arrive at the truth, to get as close as we can to facts about the brain and behavior. Not only is research misconduct doing you a disservice, it’s also a disservice to the field. And it risks your entire career. It is never right and never worth it. *Don’t do it*.

### Reproducible research

Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced (i.e. one can find the exact same results) given the *same set of data*. Reproducible research is an essential part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab.

For results to be reproducible, the analysis pipeline must be organized and well-documented. To meet these goals, you should take extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline. This means writing down how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. You should take detailed notes on your experimental design as well. Additionally, your code should be commented, and commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it, and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. Finally, it is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others. The lab’s GitHub is [https://github.com/sccnlab](https://github.com/sccnlab).

Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a *different set of data*. That is, if someone ran your study again (with a different group of participants), do they get the same results? If someone ran a conceptually similar study, do they get the same results? Science grows and builds on replicable results. Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible *and* replicable.

### Authorship
We will follow [APA guidelines](https://www.apa.org/research/responsible/publication/) with respect to authorship:

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, Stefano expects that graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and he will be the last author. All of these issues will be discussed openly, and you should feel free to talk to Stefano if you are not sure of your authorship status or want to challenge it.

#### Old projects
For projects that required significant lab resources (e.g., fMRI studies or any other study requiring a great deal of time, money, or lab effort): project "ownership" expires 3 years after data collection has ended (or whenever the original primary lead relinquishes their rights to the study, whichever comes first). At that point, Stefano may re-assign the project as needed to expedite publication. This policy is intended to avoid situations in which a dataset languishes for a long period of time, while still giving publication priority to the original primary lead.

## Human subjects research
### IRB
Because we are engaged in human subjects research, it is of the *utmost importance* that we adhere to our approved IRB protocols; non-adherence could lead to severe consequences for the entire lab (such as losing permission to run any research on human participants). **All lab members must read and comply with the approved IRB consent form and research summary for any project on which they are working.** If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask a lab coordinator or Stefano for clarification. 

To be added to an existing IRB, reach out to a lab coordinator and send them your CITI Training certificate if you haven't already. If your project does not fall under the scope of a current IRB protocol, talk to Stefano and the lab coordinator about writing a new one or filing an amendment to an existing one. You must ensure that you have IRB approval to run your study before you begin (which means that you either submitted an IRB protocol that got approved, or your name was added to an existing or amended IRB). **Lab members must complete CITI training and be added to the research personnel list for the necessary IRB protocol(s) before they can work with any human subjects _or their data_**.

### CITI training
Upon joining the lab, all lab members must complete [CITI training](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/research/sites/vice-provost-for-research/research-protections/training.html) if not yet completed, save their certificate of completion, and send it to a lab coordinator. All lab members are also expected to complete the refresher course when needed, according to the expiration date on their certificate. 

### Adverse events
If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc.), you should immediately seek assistance from Stefano or a lab coordinator. If Stefano is not around, you must notify him **within 24 hours** - always as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or funding agencies.

# General policies
## Hours
One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 35 hours a week, you should be working 35 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab coordinators and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work overtime. For graduate students, Stefano recognizes that you have other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but still expects to see you in the lab, working on research, often.

Being in lab is a good way of learning from others, helping others, building camaraderie, having fast and easy access to the resources and people you may need, and being relatively free from distractions. Stefano's primary concern is that you get your work done, so if you find that you are sometimes more productive at home, feel free to work from home occasionally. If you have no meetings, no in-person experiments, and no other obligations on  a particular day, for example, that might be a good day to work from home – but avoid making that your default, and Stefano expects to see everyone in the lab on a regular basis.

Stefano, lab coordinators, and other lab members may sometimes work late at night or on weekends. This means that they will sometimes send emails outside of normal working hours. They do not expect you to respond until you are back at work. Stefano does not expect there to be cases when he suddenly and urgently needs something from you over the weekend, but should he anticipate that happening (e.g., for a grant deadline), he will bring it up in advance so you can plan accordingly.

### PI office hours
Stefano will be in his office for at least part of each day that he is on campus. His door is often open; if it is, feel free to stop in if you need to discuss something. If his door is closed, assume that Stefano is either gone, in a meeting in his office, or is working and does not want to be disturbed – so unless it is an urgent matter, please email rather than knocking.

## Meetings
### Weekly lab meetings
Weekly lab meetings will consist mainly of individual lab members sharing brief updates about what they worked on in the past week. Lab meetings will also occasionally include project presentations from lab members, or group discussions of important/relevant papers. Lab meetings will last no longer than 1.5 hours (and will most often be shorter). All full-time lab members are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting. All part-time lab members (including undergraduates) are welcome to attend, but attendance is not required. The lab meeting day & time will be determined at the beginning of each semester based on lab members' availability. 

We will occasionally be invited to joint lab meetings with the [Morality Lab](https://moralitylab.bc.edu/) or other labs at BC. Joint lab meeting topics will include project presentations, article discussions, and invited talks. All lab members (both full-time and part-time) are encouraged, but not required, to attend.

### Invited talks
Researchers from other universities will occasionally come to the lab to give talks and host discussions about their research; such talks, typically 1-2 hours in length, are likely to be no more frequent than every other week, and scheduling will vary based on the speaker's availability. All full-time lab members are expected to attend invited talks, as their schedules permit. All part-time lab members (including undergraduates) are welcome to attend, but attendance is not required. People from other labs are welcome to attend these talks (and often do).

### One-on-one meetings
At the beginning of each semester, the lab coordinator(s) will schedule weekly one-on-one meetings between Stefano and each respective full-time lab member. The meetings are expected to last no more than one hour, but may occasionally be longer if necessary (and only if both parties' schedules allow). If you do not have anything to discuss in a given week, that's fine - you can just stop in to say hi or cancel it. Part-time lab members, such as undergraduates, that are being mentored/supervised by Stefano directly will also have a weekly meeting with him. Those without regularly weekly meetings are still welcome to schedule meetings with Stefano as needed. 

## Communication
Lab members, including Stefano and lab coordinators, may occasionally send emails or Slack messages late in the evening or on weekends/holidays, but you are not expected to immediately read or respond to messages sent at such times. Stefano encourages all lab members to prioritize time away from work and to take care of work communications during your normal working hours, whatever those may be.

### Slack
The lab uses Slack for quick, everyday communication, like sharing information about an upcoming talk, or announcing that there is leftover cake in the Psych Office. :) The lab is currently only using the free version of Slack, which has limited file storage and limited message archiving. This means that once the file & message limits are reached, older files and messages will automatically get deleted. For this reason, use email, the lab wiki, or Google Drive - not Slack - for having important conversations or sharing files that you want to be able to access again in the future.

### Email
The lab uses email for more important, long-term communication, such as sending out the semester meeting schedule or coordinating with collaborators about ongoing projects.  

#### Weekly update email
In order to stay up-to-date about lab members' progress on individual projects, Stefano *requires* all lab members whom he directly supervises (i.e. all full-time lab members, and some undergraduates) to send him a weekly update email. You should send this email to Stefano **immediately prior** to your weekly one-on-one meeting with him, and each weekly email should answer the following questions:

- **What have you worked on in the past week?**
  - Be specific - describe the tasks you worked on/completed rather than just a project name
- **What would you like to discuss during this week's meeting?**
  - Possible examples: an ongoing project, new data to share, a question about methods, career advice, a topic you've been thinking about lately, an interesting new paper you read... 

#### Email lists
The lab uses Google Groups to maintain two email lists: 1) [SCCN Lab Members](mailto:sccnlabmembers@googlegroups.com), which contains only current lab members, and 2) [SCCN Lab Meetings](mailto:sccnlabmeetings@googlegroups.com), which contains all current lab members in addition to people from other labs who are interested in attending invited talks that are hosted by our lab. Contact a lab coordinator to be added to the lab email lists. Only lab coordinators and Stefano currently have permission to send emails to these lists; emails sent by other people will bounce back. If you have something important you would like to send to the group, send it to a lab coordinator and they can send it out for you.

There is also a [lab email account](mailto:sccnlab@gmail.com) that only the lab coordinator(s) and Stefano can access - people often contact the lab (e.g. with feedback after participating in an online study) through that email address.  

## Deadlines
If you need something from Stefano by a particular deadline, please inform him *as soon as you are aware of the deadline* so that he can allocate his time as efficiently as possible, and make sure he is aware of it the closer it gets. Don’t be afraid to bug him about it. 
- Give Stefano at least one week’s notice to do something with a hard deadline that doesn’t require a lot of time (e.g., reading/commenting on conference abstracts, filling out paperwork, etc). 
- Give Stefano at least two weeks’ notice (preferably more) to do something with a hard deadline that requires a moderate amount of time (e.g., a letter of recommendation). 
- If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Stefano before a hard deadline, give him as much time as you can; at the very least three weeks.
- For manuscript submissions and revisions (i.e., which either have no deadline at all or only a weak deadline), send drafts to Stefano as soon as you have them, and bug him to give you feedback if he hasn’t responded in two weeks – papers are important!

If you do not adhere to these guidelines, Stefano may not be able to meet your deadline. 

## Presentations
Stefano encourages you to seek out opportunities to present your research to the department, research community, or general public. If you are going to give a presentation (including posters and talks), please be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more is advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time is advisable for job talks, which require much refining). Not only will this help you feel comfortable with the presentation, it will give you time to implement feedback. Stefano cares about practice presentations because a) presenting your work is a huge part of being successful in science and it's important that you practice those skills as often as possible, and b) you are going to be representing not only yourself but also the rest of the lab. 

Templates for posters will be available on the lab wiki, and you can use those as much or as little as you’d like. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (no paragraphs!), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. Other than that, go with your own style.

Stefano is also happy to share slides from some of his talks if you would like to use a similar style. You’ll get a lot of feedback on your talks in any case, but other people’s slides might be helpful to you as you are setting up your talk. As with posters, feel free to go with your own style as long as it is polished and clear. 

## Recommendation letters
Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. Stefano will write a letter for any student or lab member who has spent at least six months in the lab. Letters will be provided for shorter-term lab members in exceptional circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). If you are not sure whether your circumstances would be considered "exceptional", Stefano will be happy to discuss it with you - it's always best to just ask! Stefano maintains this guideline because he is not necessarily able to adequately evaluate someone who has been around for less than six months.

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described [above](#deadlines). Send Stefano your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. If you are applying for a grant, send him your specific aims or a short summary of the grant. In some but not all cases, he may ask you to draft a letter, which he will then revise to be consistent with his evaluation. This will ensure that he does not miss any details about your work that you think are relevant to the position you're applying for, and it will also help him complete the letter in a timely fashion.

## Data management
### Storing active datasets
In general, data will be stored in one of three places:
- **MySQL database on secure departmental server**
  - Data to store here: data saved automatically by online experiment websites
- **Lab folder on secure departmental server**
  - Data to store here: backups of the raw data from the MySQL database above

These locations are approved on our IRB protocol. They are all backed up regularly, which make them particularly appealing options for data storage. In general, you should not store data locally on your computer.

### Data organization
Lab members' project folders typically look something like this:
- `ProjectName/Data`
  - contains a folder for raw data - always keep a copy of the raw (i.e., unprocessed) data & keep it separate from the copy that you're using in your pipeline
- `ProjectName/Analysis`
  - contains folders for each type of analysis, e.g., AnalysisOne, AnalysisTwo etc.
- `ProjectName/Task`
  - contains folders for stimuli & presentation scripts, as well as any piloting info/data
- `ProjectName/Resources`
  - contains miscellaneous resources relevant to a project, e.g., ROIs, papers that are direct references for particular methods
- `ProjectName/Scripts`
  - contains subfolders for different kinds of scripts, e.g., behav, preproc, helper, model, mvpa, etc
  - the Scripts folder is git-tracked & contains a README.md file that describes as much info as possible about the study

Stefano encourages you to use an organization scheme like this one. When you archive the dataset, you will be required to format it like this (or something similarly transparent in its organization), so might as well start that way. For neuroimaging datasets, you should additionally consult the [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) framework.

### Archiving inactive datasets
Before you leave, or upon completion of a project, you must archive old datasets and back them up. We will develop the instructions for this when we reach our first inactive dataset.

### Open science
We’re all for open science, so lab members are encouraged to share their code and data with others both in and out of the lab. Within lab, you can share your code and data whenever you like. Please wait to share your code or data publicly until both you and Stefano agree that it is clean, polished, and the lab has finished working with it. This gives us an opportunity to work with the data to meet our needs (including grant needs!) before releasing it for other people to use. Generally, we will try to make our data and code publicly available within one year of publishing the results (longer if work on the dataset is ongoing).  Currently, the best option for sharing smaller datasets seems to be the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and the best option for sharing MRI datasets is [OpenFMRI](https://openfmri.org/). 

We will also share our work with the world as soon as we are ready, which means preprints! The lab policy is to upload a preprint of a manuscript simultaneously with initial submission to a journal. The preferred preprint servers are bioRxiv and PsyArXiv. We will also put PDFs of all our papers on the lab website, and you should share PDFs of your paper with whoever asks.

## Undergraduate research
Undergraduate research assistants play an important role in the lab, and we have a few opportunities for them to earn money or credit for their contributions. Because these opportunities require a certain degree of commitment from both the student and the lab, we generally reserve them for students who have already spent at least one semester volunteering in lab. If this policy would prevent you from being able to work in lab, please talk to Stefano or a lab coordinator because we want all students to be able to pursue their research interests.

In addition to volunteering in the lab, other research opportunities include:
 1. If you want to work in the lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for an [independent study or undergraduate research course](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/psychology/undergraduate/academic-opportunities/independent-courses.html). We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, present at one of them, and write a short statement about your experiences at the end of the semester. Note that you can enroll in research courses multiple times.
 2. If you want to work in the lab and earn money, you can apply for an [undergraduate research fellowship](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/sites/current-faculty.html) (click the corresponding dropdown menu for information). Candidates are expected to be academically strong (typically, GPA of 3.4 or above), and would be expected to work 12-15 hours per week. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, URF students will be strongly encouraged to participate in lab meetings. Note that if you have another BC job, you're not allowed to work more than 20 hours per week during the academic year, and that includes the URF hours (which will also count toward work-study).
 3. If you want to work in lab, earn money, and are eligible for work-study, there may be other paid research opportunities available.

If you're an undergraduate student and you want to pursue any of these options, reach out to Stefano or a lab coordinator.

# Lab resources

## Lab wiki

The lab wiki will be used as a repository for lab knowledge, particularly as it pertains to research methods and documentation of lab procedures & management. The lab wiki is a collaborative resource - if you learn something new, share it on the wiki. If you're trying to find out how to do something, search first on the wiki. The wiki is also used to store documents and files for general lab use (e.g. IRB documents, PDFs, etc.). All lab members who have access to the wiki have permission to edit it. These changes will automatically be saved in a "draft" format; however, only lab coordinators have permission to *publish* the changes, so please contact a lab coordinator each time you edit the wiki so they can review your changes and publish it for you. 

## Psychology department wiki

The Psychology Department has a well-maintained [wiki](https://bcwiki.bc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PDP&title=Psychology+Department+Procedures) (requires BC login to view) with lots of useful information and resources. If you have a question that is not answered by the lab manual or the lab wiki, especially regarding departmental procedures, your answer may be on the psych department wiki! Stefano encourages you to skim through it even if you *don't* have a question, as it can point you to resources that may be helpful to you even though you were previously unaware of their existence!

## GitHub

All projects that involve programming of any kind are encouraged to use some form of version control. We have a GitHub Team set up with unlimited private repositories, allowing you to sync your code to the cloud and share it easily with other lab members. We will also use GitHub for sharing script examples and hosting lab toolboxes for general use. The lab GitHub is [https://github.com/sccnlab](https://github.com/sccnlab).

## Google Drive

The SCCN Lab folder on Google Drive is used to store documents and files for general lab use that do not necessarily need to be on the wiki (CITI certificates, stimuli, etc.).

## Google Calendar

Google Calendar is used to host a general lab calendar (SCCN Lab). This calendar will show lab meetings, one-on-one meetings with Stefano, lab events, and lab member absences. Contact a lab coordinator or Stefano to add your expected/unexpected absences to the lab calendar.

# Lab finances

## Funding
Funding for the lab comes from:
 - Stefano's start-up package from Boston College
 - The [Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Pilot Award](https://www.sfari.org/2019/02/22/sfari-winter-2019-pilot-awardees-announced/)
 
Stefano will oversee all aspects of the financial management of our funding sources. However, it is important to him to be transparent about where research money comes from and how it's spent - please do not hesitate to ask if you want to know more details. At some point, you will likely be asked to provide a figure or two for a grant Stefano is writing, and/or provide feedback on the grant. Relatedly, you are entitled to read any grant Stefano has submitted, whether it is ultimately funded or not. Aside from being a good opportunity to learn how grants are written, this will also allow you to see his vision for the lab in the years ahead. Feel free to ask Stefano to see any of his grants.

## Conference travel

### Graduate students
See [this webpage](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/graduate/current-students/forms/graduate-student-reimbursement-guidelines.html) for detailed information regarding reimbursement for conference travel expenses for graduate students. Psi Chi, the Psychology Honors Society, also offers opportunities for its members to apply for conference travel grants.
### Undergraduate students
The University Fellowships office sometimes offers reimbursements to undergraduate students for the travel costs incurred while presenting original research at a conference. If granted, this reimbursement will cover 50% of estimated travel costs up to a maximum reimbursement amount of $750. Contact Professor Jason Cavallari at [jason.cavallari@bc.edu](mailto:jason.cavallari@bc.edu) for more information. Psi Chi, the Psychology Honors Society, also offers opportunities for its members to apply for conference travel grants.
### Other lab members
Talk to Stefano. Depending on the availability of funds, the lab will typically pay for full-time lab members (e.g. postdocs, lab coordinators) to present their work at major conferences. In general, the work should be "new" in that it has not been presented previously, and it should be appropriate for the conference. If travel expenses are being paid for with a grant, additional restrictions may apply (talk to Stefano).

## Reimbursements

Lab members can request reimbursement for out-of-pocket business expenses by filling out an expense report and emailing the completed form, as well as all relevant receipts, to the [Psych Office](mailto:psychoffice@bc.edu) (the form can be downloaded from the Forms page on the lab wiki). If the purchase was made in person rather than online, then you must submit the original receipts, along with the expense report, directly to the Psych Office (no scans or photos allowed). All expense reports should be submitted within 30 days of the incurred expense. 

Occasionally, non-lab members may incur costs for which they need reimbursement, such as the cost of an invited speaker's travel to/from the lab - in this case, a lab coordinator will fill out a Non-Employee Expense Report (found on the lab wiki) on that person's behalf.

## Lab purchases
Only Stefano and lab coordinators (when overseen by Stefano) are able to make purchases using the lab p-card. Supply requests can be made by email to a lab coordinator and can include things such as books, computer accessories, etc. General lab supplies are replenished by lab coordinators as needed. If you need something and you’re not sure if the lab is able to cover the cost or not, just ask a lab coordinator or Stefano!
